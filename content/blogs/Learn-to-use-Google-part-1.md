### <u>**Basics**</u>

**Tip 1: Start with the basics**

No matter what you're looking for, start with a simple search like `where's the closest airport?`. You can always add a few descriptive words if necessary.

If you're looking for a place or product in a specific location, add the location. For example, `bakery seattle`.

**Tip 2: Choose words carefully**

When you're deciding what words to put in the search box, try to choose words that are likely to appear on the site you're looking for. For example, instead of saying `my head hurts`, say `headache`, because that’s the word a medical site would use.

simply saying `my head hurts` won't yield anything specific.
